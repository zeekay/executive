# executive

An easy to use wrapper around `child_process.spawn`, useful for Cakefiles and the like. Pipes `stdout`, `stderr` and `stdin` so you don't have to. Think of it as a streaming `child_process.exec` with a few extra goodies.

## Usage

```javascript
var exec = require('executive');

exec('ls', function(err, out, code) {
    // Done, no need to echo out as it's piped to stdout by default.
});
```

Arguments are parsed out properly for you:
```javascript
var exec = require('executive');

exec('ls -AGF Foo\\ bar', function(err, out, code) {
    // Note the escaped folder name.
});
```

Also supports simple serial execution of commands:
```javascript
var exec = require('executive');

exec(['ls', 'ls', 'ls'], function(err, out, code) {
    // All three ls commands are called in order.
});
```

In the case of a failure, no additional commands will be executed:
```javascript
exec(['ls', 'aaaaa', 'ls'], function(err, out, code) {
    // First command succeeds, second blows up, third is never called.
});
```

Commands can also be specified as a list of objects or a mix:
```javascript
exec([
    {
        cmd: 'ls',
        args: [ '-la' ]
    },
    'ls -la',
    {
        cmd: 'ls',
        args: [ '-l' ]
    },
])
```

## Options
Options may be passed as the second argument to exec and in the case of `quiet`
and `interactive` helper functions exist.

```javascript
exec('ls', {options: quiet})
```

and

```javascript
exec.quiet('ls')
```

are equivalent.

#### options.interactive | exec.interactive
##### default `false`

If you need to interact with a program (your favorite text editor for instance)
or watch the output of a long running process (`tail -f`), or just don't care
about checking `stderr` and `stdout`, set `interactive` to `true`:

```javascript
exec.interactive('vim', function(err, out, code) {
    // Edit your commit message or whatnot
});
```

#### options.quiet | exec.quiet
##### default `false`

If you'd prefer not to pipe `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` set `quiet` to `false`:
```javascript
exec.quiet(['ls', 'ls'], function(err, out, code) {
    // Not a peep is heard, and both ls commands will be executed.
});
```

#### options.safe
##### default `true`

In case you need to ignore errors during serial execution it's possible to set
`safe` to `false`:

```javascript
exec(['ls', 'aaaaaa', 'ls'], {safe: false}, function(err, out, code) {
    // Both commands execute despite aaaaaa not being a valid executable.
});
```

## Extra credit
The spawned child process object is accessible when you exec a single program
(not available when using the simple serial execution wrapper):

```javascript
var exec = require('executive');

child = exec.quiet('ls');
child.stdout.on('data', function(data) {
    // Do your own thing
});
```

It's especially nice to use in a Cakefile:
```coffeescript
exec = require 'executive'

task 'package', 'Package project', ->
  exec '''
    mkdir -p dist
    rm -rf dist/*
    cp manifest.json dist
    cp -rf assets dist
    cp -rf lib dist
    cp -rf views dist
    zip -r package.zip dist
    rm -rf dist
  '''.split '\n'
```
